## Project Title: Hikelogger
    An app that tracks your hiking location and other features for hiking.

## Overview
    This app will add locations and deleted locations and can also edit them. It will show 
        4 different type of maps including standard, sattelite, hybrid, and terrain. The app
        is bale to add pins to locations you want mark as your start point and endpoint while you are 
        hiking somewhere. It can also show weather and track your distance in terms of meters covered.
## Install
    The app can be installed on the ios or android devices. It's developed using 
    React-Native, JS, expo, and other dependencies to make the app work
## Included Files
    Components:
        getinput.js - component that designs the background and accepts input from the user
        listitem.js - compontent that designs the list in the app
        remoteAccess.js - access to remote inforamtion 
    APP.js - main code that implements the app. It creates buttons and other functionalities that 
        are in the app such as load, save, auto, and other buttons that need to be implemented. Overall
        it has all the functionality of the app.
##  Compiling and running
    This app can be run on android or ios devices. Need to "dowload npm and node.js". You 
    have to install EXPO CLI and once everything is compiled you can run npm install and 
    install other dependencies based on the version of your OS and run "expo start" on the 
    file that has the app. Once it loads you can use your camera to open the "expo app" on 
    your phone that will show the app. 
## Program Design and Important Concepts
     The hikinglogger creates an application that displays a list of items, a map with markers, and a dialog input for adding new items. The total distance between the markers is calculated and weather data for each item is fetched and displayed.
## Testing 
    once the app runs you can look for errors in the console and the app that shows 
    what error you are making and can improve on.
## Discussion
    Overall our team put a lot of effort in the project while having finals and work.
    The project enhanced our learing of react-native and how to crate apps such as this. 
    Some parts of the project were challenging to figure out such ass getting a dialog box 
    of hiking logs to show up but our team found other solutions and added other functionalities.
