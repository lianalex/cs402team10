# Hiking Logger - Expo with React First Time Instructions

Welcome to our mobile application development project! This repository contains the source code for our mobile app built with Expo and React Native.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through setting up the development environment, installing Expo, and running the app on your local machine or physical device.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/)

### Installing Expo CLI

Open a terminal and run the following command to install the Expo CLI globally:

```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
```
## Navigate to the Project Directory

Using your preferred terminal or command-line interface, navigate to the project directory by following these steps:

1. Open the terminal on your machine.
2. Change your working directory to the location where the project repository has been closed by using the `cd` command. For example:

```Bash
cd /path/to/your-project
```
Replace `/path/to/your-project` with the actual path to the directory where the project is located.

Once you are in the correct directory, you can proceed with the next steps for setting up the project

## Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install project dependencies:
```Install Dependencies
npm install
```

## Running The App
To start Expo development server and launch the app, run:
``` Start Expo
expo start
```
Make sure that you execute that command in the directory where the react code is located.

## Expo Go App
- Download the Expo Go app on your mobile device from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-go/id982107779) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=en&gl=US).
- Open the Expo Go app and scan the QR code from the terminal using your device's camera.

## Runing on an Emulator/Simulator
If you prefer to run the app on an emulator or simulator, follow the instructions in the Expo DevTools.
